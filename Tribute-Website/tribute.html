                <h2>Itachi of the Sharingan</h2>
                <p> <b style="color: red;">Itachi Uchiha</b> (うちはイタチ, Uchiha Itachi) was a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who served
                    as an Anbu Captain. He later became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan,
                    sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. He afterwards joined the international criminal
                    organisation known as Akatsuki, whose activity brought him into frequent conflict with Konoha and
                    its ninja — including Sasuke who sought to avenge their clan by killing Itachi. Following his death,
                    Itachi's motives were revealed to be more complicated than they seemed and that his actions were
                    only ever in the interest of his brother and village, making him remain a loyal shinobi of
                    Konohagakure to the very end.At age 6, Itachi enrolled into the Academy, where he consistently
                    scored the highest in each subject and quickly learned any skill taught to him, resulting in him
                    being praised as the best his teachers had ever seen.[10][7] After four months, achieving perfect
                    grades from the start, his teachers unanimously agreed let him take the graduation exam early due to
                    Itachi being more than advanced enough for genin-level, which he passed later that month.[11] During
                    this time, he began seriously studying the history of the world, gaining a great appreciation for
                    it. On the day he graduated as the youngest post-war graduate, he was approached by Danzō Shimura,
                    who assessed Itachi's thinking.</p>

                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p><b style="color: red;">Uchiha Itachi</b> is an S-Level criminal and a Konoha Missing-nin. He graduated at the top of his Academy class at 7, had mastered the Sharingan by age 8, became a Chuunin at 10 and was previously a Black Ops (ANBU in the Japanese versions) captain at the age of only 13. At 18, he was even feared by Orochimaru. He left Konoha some years ago, after killing his whole clan except for Uchiha Sasuke, his brother. He is currently associated with Akatsuki. Orochimaru had planned to use Itachi’s body as a new container, but seeing as Itachi is powerful to such a degree that even Orochimaru fears him, it’s easy to see why Orochimaru decided to leave Akatsuki and try his luck with Sasuke instead.

                    The reason Itachi killed his clan, and the reason he left Sasuke alive only to physically and mentally abuse him, still remains a mystery. When asked why by Sasuke, he replied “To see what I am capable of.” He was until recently the sole person who possessed the Mangekyō Sharingan as revealed in the manga. Hatake Kakashi has somehow developed a new kind of Mangekyō Sharingan in the manga. Kakashi’s Mangekyō Sharingan appears different compared to Itachi’s, and the similarity in power of both Mangekyō Sharingan is still unknown.
                    
                    
                    Itachi has told Sasuke that if Sasuke were to obtain the Mangekyō Sharingan, the people able to use it will total at three. It is unknown whom the third person Itachi is referring to.</p>
